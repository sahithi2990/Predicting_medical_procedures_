# Predicting_medical_procedures_
In this project we will implement a binary classification model that could predict the success/failure outcome of a medical procedure given the attributes of the procedure. Please refer to [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/sahithi2990/Predicting_medical_procedures_/blob/main/medical%20procedures.ipynb) for more information on this project.
